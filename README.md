First slot(Productivity) at the Night of the Living Devs hackathon event.

Timemanagement system that counts down time from the estimated time the user specified when adding the task. Each main task has a description and subtasks that can be crossed out when completed. Whole timer aspect yet unfinished, but the main idea and task adding is functional.
